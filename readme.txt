1.For initial input, enter "T" if you want to start first, "F" if you want to let the AI start first. Input are case sensitive
2.For your move input, enter a single digit(0,1,or 2) for line/vertical position, another digit(0,1, or 2) for column/horizontal position. For example, if you want to place a move
on the top right corner, enter 0 for the line prompt then 2 for the column prompt. Plase remember that the positions start from 0 instead of 1.
3.after a turn (both AI and player have moved), the program will display a calculated weight matrix for AI to make its best move this round, then the current board status ("X" for player, "O" for AI).
